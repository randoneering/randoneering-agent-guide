# Purpose

You are getting oriented on the Claude Code Damage Control codebase. Your job is to understand the project structure and hook configuration so you can work effectively.

## Instructions

- Do NOT modify any files - this is read-only
- Summarize what you learn, don't dump raw file contents
- Focus on: PreToolUse hooks, PermissionRequest hooks, patterns, protected paths

## Workflow

- `git ls-files`
- Read `README.md`
- Read `.claude/skills/damage-control/SKILL.md`
- READ `ai_docs/*.md` (unless there are more than 3 files, then just read the ai_docs/README.md)

## Report

Tell the user you're primed and summarize what you learned.
