# Data Governance Instructions

Generate SQL queries against Snowflake ACCOUNT_USAGE governance data using the embedded semantic model.

## When to Use

**Access & Audit:** User access patterns, permissions, role hierarchies, query history, activity tracking  
**Classification & PII:** Sensitive data discovery, classification analysis, tables/columns without masking policies  
**Compliance:** Policy analysis (masking, row access, aggregation), grant analysis, audit trails  
**Advanced:** Cross-database access patterns, object dependencies, role effectiveness analysis

## Workflow

### Step 1: Parse Question → Identify Domain

- Access/audit → ACCESS_HISTORY, GRANTS_*
- Classification/PII → DATA_CLASSIFICATION_LATEST, TAGS
- Policies → *_POLICIES, POLICY_REFERENCES
- Objects → TABLES, VIEWS, COLUMNS, OBJECT_DEPENDENCIES

### Step 2: Check Verified Queries FIRST

Search the embedded semantic model's `verified_queries` section (100+ queries) for matching patterns:
- "who has access" → Roles/users with privileges queries
- Sensitive data → Classification and policy protection queries
- Access history → LATERAL FLATTEN patterns
- Policies → Policy-specific queries

**If match found:** Adapt the verified query SQL (adjust time filters, object names). Replace `__table_name` with `SNOWFLAKE.ACCOUNT_USAGE.TABLE_NAME` from base_table definition.

**If no match:** Generate SQL using semantic model table definitions and similar verified queries as structural reference.

### Step 3: SQL Construction Guidelines

- All tables in `SNOWFLAKE.ACCOUNT_USAGE` schema
- JSON columns (DIRECT_OBJECTS_ACCESSED, BASE_OBJECTS_ACCESSED, OBJECTS_MODIFIED) require LATERAL FLATTEN
- Use UPPER() for case-insensitive identifier matching
- Add time filters for ACCESS_HISTORY queries (QUERY_START_TIME)

### Step 4: Execute Query

Return generated SQL and results.

## Key Notes

- ACCESS_HISTORY requires LATERAL FLATTEN for column-level analysis
- Tables have up to 120 minute latency
- 100+ verified queries embedded below with proven patterns
- Use UPPER() for identifier matching

  1. Identifier Case Sensitivity and Formatting:

  When generating SQL for Snowflake, follow these key guidelines to ensure correct identifier handling and formatting::

    Unquoted identifiers (e.g., orders) must:
      - Start with a letter (A-Z, a-z) or an underscore (_)
      - Contain only letters, underscores, digits (0-9), and dollar signs ($)
      - These are interpreted by Snowflake as uppercase and are treated case-insensitively.
    To ensure accurate comparisons involving unquoted identifiers use one of the two approaches below:
      - Use uppercase directly (e.g., WHERE table_name = 'ORDERS')
      - Use the UPPER() function (e.g., WHERE table_name = UPPER('orders'))

    Quoted identifiers (e.g., "SalesData-2024'q2") are case-sensitive and must be used exactly as
     written.
      - When referencing them as values, preserve the original casing
      - Ensure the first and the last double quotes are removed if explicitly provided
      - Escape special characters as needed. Example Filter: WHERE table_name = 'SalesData-2024\\'q2'

    How to choose between Quoted and Unquoted Identifiers:
      - If an identifier is not explicitly quoted and conforms to unquoted rules, treat it as unquoted (case-insensitive)
      - Otherwise, treat it as a quoted (case-sensitive) identifier.

  2. Fully-Qualified Object Names:

    - A fully-qualified schema-level object (such as a table, view, tag, function, procedure, or file
      format) has the form: <database_name>.<schema_name>.<object_name> where each part is separated
      by a period and represents the database, schema, and object name, respectively.

    - To simplify usage, users often omit parts of the qualification from left to right. For example:
      both <schema_name>.<object_name> and <object_name> may be used to refer to objects.

    - On the other hand some object types, such as schemas and database roles, are only qualified by
       database and follow this format: <database_name>.<object_name>

    - Use the context of the user question to determine the object type, and parse the components
      accordingly when generating SQL.

  3. Query Behavior Expectations:

    - Do not add ORDER BY clauses unless the user specifically requests them or the questions clearly needs them.
    - If the question mentions tables, columns, or views, treat this as referring to relational tabular
      data stored in the user's Snowflake account. Specifically for tables and columns to not get
      confused with physical tables columns.


  4. Using ACCESS_HISTORY table and JSON data Handling:

    To analyze the ACCESS_HISTORY table, you must use LATERAL FLATTEN to extract detailed information from the JSON columns:

      - DIRECT_OBJECTS_ACCESSED
          Raw JSON array of data objects explicitly named in the query.

          STRUCTURE:
          This is an array of objects with fields such as:
          - objectDomain: Type of object (Materialized view, Procedure, Table, View, Function, Stage)
          - objectName: Fully qualified name of the object
          - objectId: Unique object identifier
          - columns: Array of columns accessed (when applicable)

      - BASE_OBJECTS_ACCESSED
          Raw JSON array of all base data objects accessed to execute the query,
          including the underlying tables for views, UDFs, and stored procedures.

          STRUCTURE:
          This is an array of objects with fields such as:
          - objectDomain: Type of object (Materialized view, Procedure, Table, View, Function, Stage)
          - objectName: Fully qualified name of the object
          - objectId: Unique object identifier
          - columns: Array of columns accessed (when applicable)

      - OBJECTS_MODIFIED
          Raw JSON array specifying the objects that were associated with a write
          operation in the query.

          STRUCTURE:
          This is an array of objects with fields such as:
          - objectDomain: Type of object (Materialized view, Procedure, Table, View, Function, Stage)
          - objectName: Fully qualified name of the object
          - objectId: Unique object identifier
          - columns: Array of modified columns with source information

      - OBJECT_MODIFIED_BY_DDL
          Raw JSON object specifying the DDL operation on database objects.

          STRUCTURE:
          This is an object with fields such as:
          - objectDomain: Type of object (Materialized view, Procedure, Table, View, Function, Stage)
          - objectName: Fully qualified name of the object
          - objectId: Object identifier
          - operationType: SQL operation (CREATE, ALTER, DROP, etc.)
          - properties: Array of object properties

    EXAMPLE QUERY:

      CREATE OR REPLACE VIEW ACCESS_HISTORY_FLATTENED AS
      SELECT
          QUERY_ID,
          QUERY_START_TIME,
          USER_NAME,
          'direct_objects' as ACCESS_TYPE,
          o_flattened.value:objectDomain::STRING AS OBJECT_DOMAIN,
          o_flattened.value:objectId::NUMBER AS OBJECT_ID,
          o_flattened.value:objectName::STRING AS OBJECT_NAME,
          c_flattened.value:columnId::NUMBER AS COLUMN_ID,
          c_flattened.value:columnName::STRING AS COLUMN_NAME,
          PARENT_QUERY_ID,
          ROOT_QUERY_ID
      FROM
          SNOWFLAKE.ACCOUNT_USAGE.ACCESS_HISTORY,
          LATERAL FLATTEN(input => DIRECT_OBJECTS_ACCESSED) o_flattened,
          LATERAL FLATTEN(input => o_flattened.value:columns) c_flattened

      UNION ALL

      SELECT
          QUERY_ID,
          QUERY_START_TIME,
          USER_NAME,
          'base_objects' as ACCESS_TYPE,
          o_flattened.value:objectDomain::STRING AS OBJECT_DOMAIN,
          o_flattened.value:objectId::NUMBER AS OBJECT_ID,

          c_flattened.value:columnName::STRING AS COLUMN_NAME,
          PARENT_QUERY_ID,
          ROOT_QUERY_ID
      FROM
          SNOWFLAKE.ACCOUNT_USAGE.ACCESS_HISTORY,
          LATERAL FLATTEN(input => BASE_OBJECTS_ACCESSED) o_flattened,
          LATERAL FLATTEN(input => o_flattened.value:columns) c_flattened

      UNION ALL

      SELECT
          QUERY_ID,
          QUERY_START_TIME,
          USER_NAME,
          'objects_modified' as ACCESS_TYPE,
          o_flattened.value:objectDomain::STRING AS OBJECT_DOMAIN,
          o_flattened.value:objectId::NUMBER AS OBJECT_ID,
          o_flattened.value:objectName::STRING AS OBJECT_NAME,
          c_flattened.value:columnId::NUMBER AS COLUMN_ID,
          c_flattened.value:columnName::STRING AS COLUMN_NAME,
          PARENT_QUERY_ID,
          ROOT_QUERY_ID
      FROM
          SNOWFLAKE.ACCOUNT_USAGE.ACCESS_HISTORY,
          LATERAL FLATTEN(input => OBJECTS_MODIFIED) o_flattened,
          LATERAL FLATTEN(input => o_flattened.value:columns) c_flattened

  5. Using DATA_CLASSIFICATION_LATEST table:
  To analyze column level data from DATA_CLASSIFICATION_LATEST table, you must use LATERAL FLATTEN to extract detailed information from the JSON columns:
      - RESULT
          Latest classification result as a VARIANT data type. This column contains a complex JSON structure
          with detailed classification information for each column in the classified table.

          THE RESULT COLUMN STRUCTURE:
          ---------------------------
          The RESULT column is a JSON object where:
          - Each key is a column name from the classified table
          - Each value is an object containing classification details for that column

          EXAMPLE STRUCTURE:
          {{
            "COLUMN_NAME": {{
              "alternates": [],
              "recommendation": {{
                "confidence": "HIGH|MEDIUM|LOW",
                "coverage": 0.9171,
                "details": [],
                "privacy_category": "IDENTIFIER",
                "semantic_category": "EMAIL"
              }},
              "valid_value_ratio": 0.9171
            }},
            "ANOTHER_COLUMN": {{
              ...
            }}
          }}

      EXAMPLE QUERY:
      WITH base_classification AS (
        SELECT
          DATABASE_NAME,
          SCHEMA_NAME,
          TABLE_NAME,
          RESULT
        FROM SNOWFLAKE.ACCOUNT_USAGE.DATA_CLASSIFICATION_LATEST
      ),
      column_categories AS (
        SELECT
          f.value:recommendation:semantic_category::STRING as SEMANTIC_CATEGORY
        FROM base_classification,
        LATERAL FLATTEN(INPUT => RESULT) f
        WHERE f.value:recommendation:semantic_category IS NOT NULL
      )
      SELECT
        SEMANTIC_CATEGORY,
        COUNT(*) as COLUMN_COUNT
      FROM column_categories
      GROUP BY SEMANTIC_CATEGORY
      ORDER BY COLUMN_COUNT DESC

  6. Consistent State of Governance Tables:

  The tables below are kept in a consistent state, and changes are propagated instantly.
  When a user is dropped from the database all the associated grants and other tables are updated
  accordingly.  You do not need to join against base tables for grants, views, tables, users,
  policy_references, and others to make sure the underlying object has not been deleted.

tables:
  - name: ACCESS_HISTORY
    description: >
      The table contains records of user access history, specifically queries executed by users.
      Each record represents a single query and includes details about the user, query execution,
      and accessed objects.
      This view is available in Enterprise Edition or higher and tracks access history
      for the last 365 days (1 year).

      Note: This table contains complex JSON arrays (DIRECT_OBJECTS_ACCESSED, BASE_OBJECTS_ACCESSED,
      and OBJECTS_MODIFIED) that require LATERAL FLATTEN operations for detailed analysis.
      Since LATERAL FLATTEN cannot be used directly in semantic model expressions, this model
      provides simplified dimensions and metrics based on these JSON columns. For detailed
      column-level access analysis, use the verified queries that demonstrate proper JSON handling
      with LATERAL FLATTEN in subsequent operations.

      This model provides dimensions that extract key information from the JSON structure without
      requiring complex JSON parsing functions in your queries.

        description: >
          Latest classification result as a VARIANT data type. This column contains a complex JSON structure
          with detailed classification information for each column in the classified table.

          THE RESULT COLUMN STRUCTURE:
          ---------------------------
          The RESULT column is a JSON object where:
          - Each key is a column name from the classified table
          - Each value is an object containing classification details for that column

          EXAMPLE STRUCTURE:
          {{
            "COLUMN_NAME": {{
              "alternates": [],
              "recommendation": {{
                "confidence": "HIGH|MEDIUM|LOW",
                "coverage": 0.9171,
                "details": [],
                "privacy_category": "IDENTIFIER",
                "semantic_category": "EMAIL"
              }},
              "valid_value_ratio": 0.9171
            }},
            "ANOTHER_COLUMN": {{
              ...
            }}
          }}

          HOW TO ACCESS THIS DATA:
          -----------------------
          1. To extract information for a specific column:
             SELECT GET_PATH(RESULT, 'COLUMN_NAME') as column_classification
             FROM DATA_CLASSIFICATION_LATEST

          2. To extract a specific property for a column:
             SELECT GET_PATH(RESULT, 'COLUMN_NAME:recommendation:semantic_category')::STRING
             FROM DATA_CLASSIFICATION_LATEST

          Note: This is the raw JSON variant column. Advanced JSON parsing with functions like
          LATERAL FLATTEN cannot be used directly as column expressions in the semantic model.
          Instead, these operations need to be performed in subsequent queries.

  - name: OBJECT_DEPENDENCIES
    description: 'Object Dependencies. It tracks when one object (the referencing object)
      references another object (the referenced object) without materializing or copying data. For example, when creating
      a view from a table, the view depends on the table and this dependency is recorded. The view has a latency of up to
      3 hours and was backfilled with historical data from January 22, 2022.

      Usage information:
      - Dependencies are tracked for Snowflake objects only, not external objects like S3 buckets
      - Data movement operations (CTAS, INSERT, MERGE) do not create dependencies
      - Session parameters in object definitions may cause inaccurate dependency tracking
      - Dependencies through function calls or nested objects may not be captured
      - BY_NAME_AND_ID dependencies may not be recorded after CREATE OR REPLACE operations

      Contains detailed information about object dependencies in Snowflake, tracking both the referenced (source)
      and referencing (dependent) objects. Each row represents a single dependency relationship.'
